## My Library

This repo will serve to document my journey throughout each book that I read. It will give me a chance to practice the
material within the book, as well as serve as a very informative resource to look back on.

Here is a list of the books in the repo:

- Text Mining with R: A Tidy Approach, by Julia Silge
- Neural Networks with R: Giuseppe Ciaburro
- Machine Learning with R: Expert techniques for predictive modeling, 3rd Edition, by Brett Lantz

If you are interested in looking at other materials i've used to learn, check out my documentation of the Rstudio webinars
i've watched under my rstudio_webinars repo.
